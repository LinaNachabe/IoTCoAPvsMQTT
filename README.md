# **IoTCoAPvsMQTT**  

## **Description**  
This repository explores a comparative analysis of **MQTT** and **CoAP** protocols in large-scale IoT networks. The tests are performed collaboratively to evaluate performance, scalability, and efficiency.  

Each group will:  
1. Create a branch with their project topic as the name.  
2. Modify their branch to include specific contributions as detailed below.

## **Branch Structure and Guidelines**  

### **1. Branch Name**  
Each group must name their branch based on their project topic, e.g., `GRP-ProjectTopic`.

#### **a. README.md**  
- Include the project topic title and a brief description of the groupâ€™s focus.  

#### **b. Communication Protocol Folder**  
- Contains a presentation detailing the respective communication protocol (MQTT or CoAP).  

#### **c. CoAP Implementation Folder**  
- A `README.md` file documenting:  
  - Implementation steps.  
  - Results and observations.
